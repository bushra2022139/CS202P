      <p class="video-description">An optical microscope, which creates images with light, a scanning or transmission electron microscope, which uses electrons, or a scanning probe microscope, which uses a probe, all aim to produce crisp, high-quality images. The most popular kind of microscopes are upright ones, which have the lighting system beneath the stage and the lens system above. Inverted microscopes, which are especially helpful for cell culture, have the opposite arrangement. Applications span geology, microelectronics, nanophysics, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical research.</p>

      <p class="video-description">Hemoglobin concentration clinical diagnostic analysis is a routine blood test. Hemoglobin analyzers are used for these kinds of analyses. Hemoglobin concentrations in blood or urine samples can be reported in g/L, g/dL, or mol/L by hemoglobin analyzers, also known as HbA1c Analyzers. Tests using samples as small as 1uL can be completed in a matter of minutes by HbA1c Analyzers. Each red blood cell (RBC) contains a protein called hemoglobin, which contains iron and is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. Hemoglobin binds to gases other than oxygen, including nitric oxide, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Hemoglobins come in various varieties, some of which are known to cause illnesses like sickle-cell anemia.</p>

      <p class="video-description">Complete blood counts (CBCs) can be quickly determined from whole blood specimens using automated hematology analyzers. Hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, leukocyte differential, white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts, platelet counts, and hemoglobin concentration are among the results. In certain cases, less advanced automated hematology analyzers in doctor's offices may offer a limited complete blood count (CBC), producing a three-part leukocyte differential only by utilizing outdated whole blood analysis technology (such as impedance technology).</p>

      <p class="video-description">Clinical laboratories frequently use biochemistry analyzers, a type of medical laboratory equipment. It is intended to perform tests on a variety of test samples, including blood, plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, to measure chemicals at different stages of biological processes. Stated differently, it facilitates the examination, assessment, and analysis of the attributes of various body samples and addresses a wide range of issues facing the medical sector. Numerous factors, including speed (the number of samples the analyzer analyzes in an hour) and random access mode (which enables random and continuous sample loading and expedites the retrieval of results for various patients), can be used to assess the performance of biochemistry analyzers.</p>
